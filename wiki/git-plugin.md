## Git-Godot plugin

- The plugin is just a small helper that lets you use
    git from within godot editor,
    without having to tab over to a terminal
- It doesn't do cool things like merging conflicted
    scenes visually or anything
- You can install it from the asset library inside
    the godot editor or manually from github
- If you install it, please
    add `addons/godot-git-plugin` to `.gitignore`
    so you're not checking the plugin into our git
